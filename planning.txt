Team Branching Model:

NEW FEATURE
1. 	(deprecate any previous branch)
2. 	switch branch to master 
		git checkout master

3. 	get the latest changes from master
		git pull

	--> confirm that master has been update on local; check comments
4. 	create a new branch (naming convention: featureName-yourname)
		git branch exampleFeature-alex

5. 	switch to your branch
		git checkout exampleFeature-alex

6. 	make ALL updates on your feature branch (commit often!)
		try to PUSH your branch at least once before you're ready to push to master

7.	WHEN YOU ARE READY TO MERGE TO MASTER, OR: NEED CHANGE FROM TEAM:
		make final commit on your feature branch, and push
		git push

8. 	(REMOTE)
		go to github --> create a pull request 
		new PUll request:  master <-- featureBranch

		if -server:  PAUL will resolve conflicts and confirm pull request
		if -client: ALEX will resolve conflicts and confirm pull request

9.  (LOCAL)
		switch to master branch
		git checkout master

10. pull latest changes from master
		git pull
